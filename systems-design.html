                    World On Fire (X-Ray Vision / Radar Sense) is a <u>modular, post-processing effect</u> that allows the player to see through walls to locate enemies and items of interest.
                    The effect is achieved using a <u>custom depth pass and a post-process material</u> that highlights objects based on their stencil value.
                    It has <u>different colors</u> for different object types, such as enemies and items, to enhance situational awareness.

                <p>
                    This was my first real dive into <u>advanced materials and post-processing</u>, and it was a huge learning curve.
                    I was inspired by sensing abilities in games like Batman: Arkham and really wanted to build a "world on fire" mode for my Daredevil project.
                    The biggest technical hurdle was figuring out <u>how to use custom depth and stencil buffers</u> to properly highlight enemies, items, and objectives through walls.
                    I'm proud of the result because it’s a <u>clean, reusable post-process effect</u> that I can now easily drop into other projects to highlight any object.

                <p>
                    The parkour system is a comprehensive movement system that includes various mechanics such as <u>sprinting, mantling, sliding, rolling,
                    grappling hook, and different types of jumps</u> (vault, double jump, triple jump, spin jump, and long jump).
                    This is an important part of my Daredevil fan game as it focuses almost completely on combat and parkour.

                <p>
                    This system felt <u>overwhelmingly complex</u> when I started, especially when thinking about all the different <u>player states like mantling, vaulting, and sliding</u>.
                    Watching a few tutorials gave me a great starting point, but I quickly realized the real challenge was in adapting those lessons and building a much larger, more robust system.
                    It taught me that a good parkour system is all about <u>"game feel,"</u> and I was able to build a flexible system with <u>many different jump types</u> from the ground up.

                    The interaction system is an <u>actor component</u> that can be added to the player to make them interact with certain blueprints.
                    The system supports <u>different types of interactions</u>, such as single press, hold for any duration, and tap repeatedly any number of times.

                <p>
                    I designed this system to be <u>simple on the surface but powerful and flexible under the hood</u>.
                    My main goal was to build it as a <u>modular Actor Component</u>, which lets me just drop it onto any character blueprint and have it work instantly.
                    I used <u>Blueprint Interfaces</u> to handle all the communication, which makes it super easy to add new interaction types like "single press," "hold," or "mash" without rewriting old code.
                    This project was a great lesson in <u>object-oriented programming</u>, which taught me spending a little extra time on the architecture could save a lot of work later.

                    This is a comprehensive series of YouTube videos by Ali Elzoheiry on different types of enemy AI, including <u>melee, ranged, and magic enemies.</u>
                    The AI uses <u>behavior trees and blackboards</u> to manage their states and actions, allowing for complex behaviors such as patrolling, chasing, and attacking the player.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is part of a learning exercise, during my time as a systems designer at Mars Games, to understand AI programming in Unreal Engine 5.
                    The system is designed to be modular and can be easily integrated into any Unreal Engine 5 project.

                    This was by far the <u>most complex system</u> I've tackled, but I was determined to learn how <u>professional AI is built in Unreal</u>.
                    I followed a very comprehensive YouTube series that did a great job of breaking down every single detail, which was the perfect way to learn such a deep topic.
                    I finally understood how <u>Behavior Trees and Blackboards communicate</u> to make all the different AI states work.
                    This project was a huge confidence boost, as I now have a <u>solid grasp on AI</u>, from perception and sensing to managing patrol, chase, and attack logic.
