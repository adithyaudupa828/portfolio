                    What I learnt:

                <p>
                    Handling both <u>UI and 3D asset modeling</u> for a game was a good challenge.
                    I taught myself how to use <u>Unreal's UMG system</u> to build all the menus and the player's inventory from scratch.
                    For the 3D modeling, I learned how to <u>create low-poly, game-ready ingredients in Blender</u> that would look good without slowing the game down.
                    It was a great lesson in how much these art roles support game design, as the UI had to be clean for the player and the models had to be recognizable at a glance.

                <h3>Pac-Man Style Game</h3>

                    Roles: UI design, systems design, enemy AI, simple combat.
                </h3>
                <p>
                    This is a simple game similar to Pac-Man, but in 3D. The player has to <u>navigate a densely populated environment to collect coins</u>.
                    The villagers have a simple <u>perception system</u> and follow the player while in range.
                    They have a single axe-swing animation that reduces player lives when connected.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I created the combat, player boost, AI behavior, coin collection system, and UI elements. The environment is an asset pack from the Fab store.

                </h3>
                <p>
                    This project was a personal challenge to see if I could build a <u>complete, simple game loop</u> all by myself.
                    I was inspired by Pac-Man and wanted to capture that "collect-and-avoid" tension in a 3D space.
                    The biggest surprise was how tricky it was to design the animations and simple AI for the villagers.
                    It taught me that <u>"simple" is not the same as "easy,"</u> and I learned how to connect player controls, AI, UI, and win/lose conditions into one finished package.

                    Inspired by the YouTube video created by Unreal Sensei, I tried recreating a similar landscape with the same assets. This landscape is for <u>cinematic shots</u>.
                    The castle is made using modular pieces from the Fab, and the landscape is made using Unreal Engine 5's landscape tools and foliage system.

                <p>
                    My goal here was to follow a professional tutorial to create a <u>beautiful, cinematic landscape scene</u>.
                    I got completely carried away with the foliage tools and proudly placed over 10,000 trees, bushes, and rocks to make it look dense and realistic. Of course, I had built a scene that was completely unplayable.
                    This taught me about <u>optimization, draw calls</u>, and the critical difference between a <u>"cinematic" and a "game-ready" level</u>.
